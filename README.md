# Ohmyfood!
## This is the third project of the OpenClassrooms Dev Web courses.

### Ohmyfood! is an online meal ordering company. 
Our concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce their waiting time in restaurants because their meals are prepared in advance. 
No more waste of time consulting the card!
