# Ohmyfood!
## This is the third project of the OpenClassrooms Dev Web courses.

### Ohmyfood! is an online meal ordering company. 
Our concept allows users to compose their own menu and reduce their waiting time in the restaurants because their menu is prepared in advance. 
No more wasting time consulting the card!
